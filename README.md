## üßê Overview
This project is aimed to get weather data that exist in the market. It adds a pretty interface that can be used freely. The logic is using the fetch promises to make the api work on the server and make beautiful results.
- I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
- I used ES6 when writing the code.
- I made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.
- I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

## Instructions

<ins>***Getting Started***</ins> : 
- Click ***`node server.js`*** in terminal to start the local server on port 8000.
- Go to the ***http://localhost*** followed by the port to see the project.
- All you need is to write the **`ZIP`** code of the city (United States).
* You can write your **`Feeling`** if you want [optional].
And then You will get:
  - the name of the city. 
  - the temperature.
  - the date.
  - description of weather.
  - your feelings.
- The application has a server side so if you want to launch it on a live shared hosting make sure it is one that support backend server.
